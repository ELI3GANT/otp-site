# How to MAKE THIS SITE COOK 🍳

You now have a **Professional Grade Web Application**. It's not just a website; it's a platform.
Here is your roadmap to taking it from "Great" to "World Class".

## 1. Visuals: The "WebGL" Upgrade
You are a video production studio. Your site should *feel* like a video.
*   **The Idea:** Implement a "Distortion Hover Effect" on your `archive.html` images. When the mouse moves over a thumbnail, it shouldn't just scale; it should "liquid warp" using WebGL.2
*   **The Tool:** Use [Curtains.js](https://www.curtainsjs.com/) or [Ogl](https://github.com/oframe/ogl).
*   **Why:** It signals "High Budget" immediately.

## 2. Content: The "SEO" Domination
You have the Blog Engine (`insights.html`). Now use it.
*   **The Strategy:** Write 1 article a week about *specific* problems your clients have.
    *   *Bad Title:* "Our New Camera."
    *   *Cook Title:* "Why 4K Delivery is Killing Your Social Reach (And How We Fix It)."
*   **The Result:** Clients will find you via Google instead of you chasing them.

## 3. Client Experience: The "Portal" (Next Level)
Right now, you are taking leads via the form.
*   **The Upgrade:** Build a "Project Status" page.
*   **How:** Create a table `projects` in Supabase with `client_email`, `status`, `review_link`.
*   **The Magic:** When a client types their email into a "Check Status" box, show them:
    *   🟢 Editing in Progress
    *   📅 Delivery: Friday
    *   🔗 [Review V1 Link]
*   **Why:** It makes you look organized and premium.

## 4. Conversion: The "Lead Magnet"
*   **The Idea:** Don't just ask for "Contact." Give them something.
*   **Action:** Create a "Free Guide to Music Video Pre-Production" PDF.
*   **Flow:** They enter email -> Automations send PDF -> You have their email for life.

## 5. Analytics: Watch the Tape
*   **Action:** Fix that PostHog integration (once you find the key).
*   **Why:** Watch "Session Replays". If you see people clicking a video and immediately leaving, change the thumbnail. Optimize based on real data.
